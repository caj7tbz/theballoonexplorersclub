<p>On Tuesday, The Balloon Explorers Club had the distinct pleasure and fortune
	 to interview the legendary and mysterious Cannon Johns</p>

<p><em>BEC:</em> Thank you Mr. Johns for agreeing to this one on one interview with us. We know your schedule can be quite demanding. 
</p>
<p><em>Johns:</em> I always have time for my favorite balloon explorers club.  
</p>
<p><em>BEC:</em> Mr. Johns, when you were a child...did you plan on being the greatest balloon explorer this world has ever seen?
</p>
<p><em>Johns:</em> Yes, actually. 
</p>
<p><em>BEC:</em> You are world-renown for your daring escapes and your ability to overcome the most dangerous of odds. 
Can you tell us about your most death-defying escape?  
</p>
<p> Johns: It was a clear, dark night and I was flying in my balloon 
over the vast Amazon jungle. In a matter of moments, the sky opened up and the weather turned violent. 
I saw lightning strike only a few feet from me. 
I knew I had no other choice but to land the balloon in the middle of the jungle and wait it out.  Well, as luck would have it, 
I landed my balloon right in the middle of a hyena den. And if you know anything about hyenas, 
you know that they intentionally starve themselves for days in order to feast during a full moon. 
And yup, you guessed it, it was a full moon. 
They formed a circle around me slowly closing in. There had to be at least 30 of them. 
I reached around to my back to pull out my samurai sword, but then I thought better of it. No matter the circumstances, 
I had to uphold the Matterhorn family honor to never hurt an animal. Then I had an idea. 
I reached into my balloon's basket and pulled out one of my prized possessions...
a trumpet that was bequeathed to me by Louis Armstrong. I knew I had one shot. I put the trumpet to my lips and started blowing. 
I don't mean to boast or anything, but the sound that came out of that horn was enchanting. 
The hyenas immediately just froze where they stood, hypnotized by the music. 
When I was finally done playing, the hyenas approached me with kindness in their eyes and ushered me into their den. 
We enjoyed a fantastic meal of venison and they allowed me to sleep through the storm in their den. 
</p>
<p><em>BCE:</em> Wow.
</p>
<p>Johns: I know. Pretty amazing, stuff huh? 
</p>
<p><em>BEC:</em> Sure is. Well thank you Mr. Johns. You are a hero to us all.
</p>
<p>Johns: No I am not. The real heroes are the teachers who are inspiring and encouraging the future of the world.
